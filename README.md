# STATS220

## University of Auckland

This repository has been set up to support my work as a student in **STATS220** at the University of Auckland. I am currently working on the course's first project, which includes:
1. Setting up this GitHub page and repository.
2. Creating and animating a meme in RStudio.
3. Writing and submitting a report on the above using R Markdown.

I am studying a **Bachelor of Communication (BC)**, majoring in Communication and Technology. I have a working background in politics and political communication, and am currently employed part-time as an MP Support Coordinator and Communications Advisor to two Auckland MPs.

Some of my key interests in pursuing a BC are:
* The future of communication technology and how things like social media have changed the way we communicate.
* Advances in artificial intelligence and it's impact on communication and society.
* How governments and political operations can use new and existing communication tools to reach people who are increasingly ignoring their messaging.
