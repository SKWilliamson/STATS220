# STATS220

## University of Auckland

This repository has been setup to support my work as a student in **STATS220** at the University of Auckland.

I am studying a **Bachelor of Communication (BC)**, majoring in Communication and Technology. I have a working background in politics, and am currently employed part-time as a communications advisor to two MPs.

Some of my key interests in pursuing a BC are:
* The future of communication technology and how things like social media have changed the way we communicate.
* Advances in artificial intelligence and it's impact on communication and society.
* How governments and political operations can use new and existing communication tools to reach people who are increasingly ignoring such messaging.
